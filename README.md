# Zeebra is ZEro-knowledge algEBRA
[![CI](https://github.com/mfaulk/zeebra/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mfaulk/zeebra/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

Zeebra implements a subset of computational algebra and number theory for zero-knowledge cryptography.

## Why You Should Use Zeebra
As the saying goes, you can either make software so simple that it obviously has no bugs, or so complicated that it has no obvious bugs. Zeebra emphasizes clear documentation,  published references for algorithmic implementations, interoperability with Sage, and property-based testing for exhaustive test coverage.

## Building and Testing
Zeebra builds on stable Rust; no nightly toolchain or feature gates are required.

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
```

Development checks, matching what CI enforces:

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
```

Some tests compare the optimized Gröbner engine against the naive reference implementation, or
factor large integers, on inputs slow enough to take minutes. They are `#[ignore]`d so the default
suite stays fast, and need release mode to finish in reasonable time:

```sh
cargo test --release -- --ignored test_optimized_agrees_with_reference_on_slow_systems
cargo test --release -- --ignored test_f4_on_larger_systems
cargo test --release -- --ignored test_factorization
```

Four other `#[ignore]`d tests are unimplemented placeholders for statistical distribution checks
and a rare division branch, and they panic if run. A bare `cargo test -- --ignored` therefore
reports those four as failures; the commands above select the tests that are meant to pass.

CI runs the two Gröbner engine-agreement tests among those in a separate release-mode job, so the
cross-check against the naive reference implementation is enforced rather than merely available.

### Benchmarks

Criterion benchmarks cover field arithmetic, sparse polynomial operations, dense and sparse linear
algebra, and Gröbner basis computation:

```sh
cargo bench                              # everything
cargo bench --bench grobner              # one suite
cargo bench --bench sparse_linear_algebra
cargo bench --bench f4_stages
```

`sparse_linear_algebra` runs sparse and dense elimination on identical matrices at several sizes
and densities, because sparse storage is not unconditionally faster — above some density the
bookkeeping costs more than the arithmetic it saves.

`f4_stages` times F4's stages separately — symbolic preprocessing, matrix construction,
elimination, and a whole batch — replaying the batches a real computation produced rather than
synthetic ones. `grobner` says whether something got faster; `f4_stages` says whether a change
removed cost or moved it from one stage to another.

Wall-clock time alone does not say *why* a Gröbner computation got faster. For the algorithmic
counters — pairs considered, pairs eliminated by Buchberger's first criterion, reductions, zero
reductions, basis size:

```sh
cargo run --release --example grobner_statistics   # Buchberger
cargo run --release --example f4_statistics        # F4, beside Buchberger
cargo run --release --example f4_profile           # F4, cost attributed per stage
cargo run --release --example f4_profile -- list   # the configurations available
cargo run --release --example f4_blocks            # F4, row arrangements of the Macaulay matrix
```

`f4_statistics` prints matrix dimensions, how many reductions each matrix absorbed, how much of
each matrix was reduction scaffolding, and how much elimination filled it in. It asserts that the
two engines agree wherever both can run.

`f4_profile` prints where the time went: symbolic preprocessing, construction, elimination,
candidate extraction, and the final interreduction, with the remainder shown as `other` so an
unattributed cost cannot hide. It takes the name of a configuration — `baseline` by default — so
the effect of one optimization can be read off against another's. The timing comes from
`F4Options::measure_stages`, which reads a clock four times per batch and is off by default.

`f4_blocks` replays the batches a computation really built and eliminates each one four ways —
rows as preprocessing produced them, reducer rows first, reducer rows taken as established pivots,
and the same with the reducer block interreduced — reporting row operations, peak live nonzeros,
final nonzeros, and time on the identical matrices. Holding the matrix fixed is the point: a
change of row arrangement changes which candidates come out, hence every later batch, so the
whole-computation effect and the per-elimination effect are different measurements.

Recorded baselines, before/after measurements, and the reasoning behind each optimization are in
[`docs/MILESTONE-ALGEBRA-FOUNDATION.md`](docs/MILESTONE-ALGEBRA-FOUNDATION.md) and
[`docs/MILESTONE-F4.md`](docs/MILESTONE-F4.md).

## Gröbner Bases

`grobner::buchberger` computes a reduced Gröbner basis under a chosen monomial order. All three
standard orders are available, and `MonomialOrder` is exported from the crate root:

```rust
use zeebra::{fields::Zp13, grobner::buchberger, MonomialOrder, MultivariatePolynomial};

let vars = ["x", "y", "z"];
let system = vec![
    MultivariatePolynomial::<3, Zp13>::parse("x*z - y^2", vars).unwrap(),
    MultivariatePolynomial::<3, Zp13>::parse("x^3 - z^2", vars).unwrap(),
];

let basis = buchberger(&system, MonomialOrder::GradedReverseLexicographic);
```

The returned basis is reduced and in a deterministic order, so it is reproducible across runs.
Which order you pick matters: graded reverse lexicographic is usually cheapest, while lexicographic
is what makes a system easy to solve by back-substitution and can be dramatically more expensive.

`buchberger_with_statistics` returns the same basis alongside counters describing the computation,
which is useful for understanding cost on a hard system. `grobner::benchmark_systems` provides the
standard `cyclic` and `katsura` families plus `planted`, which builds a zero-dimensional system
around a solution you choose. `grobner::reference` holds a deliberately naive textbook
implementation kept as a correctness oracle — use `buchberger` or `f4` for real work.

### F4

`grobner::f4` computes the same basis by Faugère's F4 algorithm, which replaces individual
S-polynomial reductions with batched symbolic preprocessing and sparse finite-field linear algebra:

```rust
use zeebra::{fields::Zp13, grobner::f4, MonomialOrder, MultivariatePolynomial};

let vars = ["x", "y", "z"];
let system = vec![
    MultivariatePolynomial::<3, Zp13>::parse("x*z - y^2", vars).unwrap(),
    MultivariatePolynomial::<3, Zp13>::parse("x^3 - z^2", vars).unwrap(),
];

let basis = f4(&system, MonomialOrder::GradedReverseLexicographic).unwrap();
```

A reduced Gröbner basis is unique for a given ideal and order, so `f4` and `buchberger` return
exactly the same thing, with the same handling of zero, duplicate, and redundant generators. They
differ only in how they get there, and therefore in cost.

**Which to use.** `buchberger` is the better choice on small systems, where building a matrix costs
more than the reductions it replaces. F4 pays off where Buchberger wastes the most work: on
katsura-5 under lex, Buchberger reduces 1790 S-polynomials and 1725 of them come out zero, while
F4 covers the same ground in 29 matrices. See
[`docs/MILESTONE-F4.md`](docs/MILESTONE-F4.md) for measurements, including the cases where F4
loses.

`f4` returns a `Result`: an F4 matrix can grow far beyond what its inputs suggest, and elimination
can make it denser still, so both are budgeted. Exceeding a budget is an `F4Error` naming the limit
— never a basis that looks complete and is not. `f4_with_options` takes an `F4Options` and returns
`F4Statistics` alongside the basis:

```rust
use zeebra::{fields::Zp13, grobner::{f4_with_options, F4Options}, MonomialOrder, MultivariatePolynomial};

let vars = ["x", "y", "z"];
let system = vec![MultivariatePolynomial::<3, Zp13>::parse("x*z - y^2", vars).unwrap()];
let options = F4Options { max_pairs_per_batch: Some(16), ..F4Options::default() };

let (basis, statistics) =
    f4_with_options(&system, MonomialOrder::GradedReverseLexicographic, &options).unwrap();
println!("{} batches, largest matrix {} x {}",
    statistics.batches, statistics.max_matrix_rows, statistics.max_matrix_columns);
```

`max_pairs_per_batch: Some(1)` reduces one S-polynomial per matrix, which is useful for isolating
the effect of batching; the answer does not change, only the number and shape of the matrices.

#### Choosing a strategy

`F4Options` also selects *how* the computation is performed. A reduced Gröbner basis is unique for
a given ideal and order, so **no strategy changes the answer** — only the cost. Each is a separate
field rather than one "fast" switch, so that the contribution of each can be measured on its own:

| Field | Choices | What it changes |
|---|---|---|
| `elimination` | `Backend::{Sparse, Dense, Adaptive}` | the representation elimination works in |
| `reduction` | `ReductionStrategy::{Unstructured, Structured}` | whether reducer rows are established as pivots before the pair rows are reduced against them |
| `reducer_selection` | `ReducerSelection::{FirstApplicable, LargestLeadingMonomial}` | which basis element symbolic preprocessing picks to reduce a monomial |
| `criteria` | `PairCriteria { product, chain, gebauer_moller }` | which criteria may discard a critical pair before a matrix is built |
| `reducer_cache` | `CacheMode::{Off, Count, Store}` | whether reducer multiples are remembered between batches; `Count` measures repetition without serving anything |
| `measure_stages` | `bool` | whether `F4Statistics::stages` is populated |

`ReductionStrategy::Structured` exploits the fact that symbolic preprocessing gives every reducer
multiple a distinct leading monomial, none of them a critical pair's lcm: putting those rows first,
descending by leading monomial, makes the upper-left block unit upper triangular without any work,
so elimination takes those pivots as given and never reduces the block against anything. It
performs *more* row operations than the one-pass path and far less fill-in — on katsura-7 under
grevlex, 8% of the baseline's peak live entries — which is a net win on the dense grevlex and lex
instances and a small loss under grlex. The per-order numbers are in
[`docs/MILESTONE-F4-OPTIMIZATION.md`](docs/MILESTONE-F4-OPTIMIZATION.md) §7.1.

`F4Options::baseline()` names the configuration every optimization is measured against, and is
kept available separately from `default()` so that a comparison stays meaningful after the default
moves. `PairCriteria::NONE` reduces every pair, which is the reference the criteria are checked
against: a criterion is sound exactly when enabling it does not change the basis.

`grobner::solve` still uses `buchberger`. The sparse linear algebra F4 is built on is reusable on
its own, as `linalg::sparse`; `linalg::echelon` is the backend-selecting interface over it.

`grobner::trace_batches` runs a computation and returns every batch it reduced, each as the basis
at the time plus the pairs selected. That is what lets a stage be benchmarked or counted on real
input instead of on a synthetic approximation of it; `benches/f4_stages.rs` is built on it.

Field elements reject non-canonical representatives on deserialization. Every value this crate
serializes round-trips unchanged, but bytes encoding an integer outside `[0, P)` are an error
rather than being silently reduced, since they indicate corruption or a mismatched modulus.

## Solving Polynomial Systems
`grobner::solve` finds every point of F^N at which a system of multivariate polynomials
vanishes, over a finite field F:

```rust
use rand::{prelude::StdRng, SeedableRng};
use zeebra::{fields::Zp13, grobner::solve, MultivariatePolynomial};

let vars = ["x", "y"];
let system = vec![
    MultivariatePolynomial::<2, Zp13>::parse("x + y", vars).unwrap(),
    MultivariatePolynomial::<2, Zp13>::parse("x*y - 1", vars).unwrap(),
];

let mut rng = StdRng::seed_from_u64(0);
for point in solve(&system, &mut rng) {
    println!("x = {}, y = {}", point[0], point[1]);
}
```

It computes a lexicographic Grobner basis, which is triangular, then assigns variables from the
last backwards. At each step the basis polynomials that have become univariate in the current
variable are solved with `roots`, so only their common roots are tried. An inconsistent system is
detected from its basis being `{1}` and yields no points. The order of the returned points is
unspecified.

A system with finitely many solutions therefore needs no enumeration, and works over fields far
too large to list — the tests cover GF(2^31 - 1) and the largest 64-bit prime.

A system that leaves a variable unconstrained is the exception. Its solution set grows with the
field, so covering a free variable means enumerating, and `solve` refuses above an order of 2^20.
That is a limit on the size of the answer rather than on the method.

## Factoring Univariate Polynomials
`factorize` returns the monic irreducible factors of a univariate polynomial over a finite field,
with multiplicities, and `is_irreducible` tests a single polynomial:

```rust
use rand::{prelude::StdRng, SeedableRng};
use zeebra::{factorize, fields::Zp7, is_irreducible, FiniteField, UnivariatePolynomial};

// x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) over GF(7)
let f = UnivariatePolynomial::<Zp7>::new(&[
    Zp7::new(6), Zp7::new(11), Zp7::new(6), Zp7::new(1),
]);

let mut rng = StdRng::seed_from_u64(0);
for (factor, multiplicity) in factorize(&f, &mut rng) {
    assert!(is_irreducible(&factor));
    println!("({})^{}", factor, multiplicity);
}
```

The distinct irreducible factors of each degree are collected with `gcd(f, x^(q^d) - x)`, then
each group of equal-degree factors is separated by Cantor–Zassenhaus splitting. Because
`x^(q^d) - x` is squarefree, that gcd gives the distinct factors whatever the multiplicities in
`f` are — so no squarefree decomposition is needed, and `x^p` in characteristic `p`, whose
derivative vanishes, needs no special handling. Multiplicities are recovered afterwards by
division.

Splitting is randomized, so this takes an rng and the order of the returned factors is
unspecified.
